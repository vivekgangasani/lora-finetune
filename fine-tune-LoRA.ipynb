    "\n",
    "We are going to use the recently introduced method in the paper \"[QLoRA: Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adapter Tuning for Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314)\" by Tim Dettmers et al. QLoRA is a new technique to reduce the memory footprint of large language models during finetuning, without sacrificing performance. The TL;DR; of how QLoRA works is: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantize the pretrained model to 4 bits and freezing it.\n",
    "* Attach small, trainable adapter layers. (LoRA)\n",
    "* Finetune only the adapter layers, while using the frozen quantized model for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a [run_qlora.py](./scripts/run_qlora.py), which implements QLora using PEFT to train our model. The script also merges the LoRA weights into the model weights after training. That way you can use the model as a normal model without any additional code. The model will be temporally offloaded to disk, if it is too large to fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Addition to QLoRA we will leverage the new [Flash Attention 2 integrationg with Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_infer_gpu_one#flash-attention-2) to speed up the training. Flash Attention 2 is a new efficient attention mechanism that is up to 3x faster than the standard attention mechanism. "

    "[Amazon SageMaker supports streaming responses](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/machine-learning/elevating-the-generative-ai-experience-introducing-streaming-support-in-amazon-sagemaker-hosting/) from your model. We can use this to stream responses, we can leverage this to create a streaming gradio application with a better user experience.\n",

The application will stream the responses from the model and display them in the UI. You can also use the application to test your model with your own inputs."
